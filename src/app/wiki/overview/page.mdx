<div className="info">
You will find Jason hanging out in his library to the left of your spawnpoint. He seems to always loosing his books.
</div>

We highly recommend seeing Jason before doing anything else on the server. He will fill you in on everything you've missed prior to your arrival, give you direction, and a few tools to get you started.

<div className="warning">
Make sure you pay attention to Jason's guide. This information sets the foundation for the rest of your journey!

# Step 2: Go Meet Your Neighbors
The first thing anyone should do when moving to a new environment is familiarize themselves with it. Go out and say hello to your new friends. Players and NPCs alike. The majority of NPCs around spawn provide very useful information on the core features of the server.

# Step 3: Visit Columbus & Begin Your Quests
Columbus is the cove's quest master. He takes care of all tasks that need to be done for the island in preparation for the big siege. You should see him as soon as you finish exploring spawn so you can get your journey started.

Once you see him, hop on the ship and speak to Captain Jack to set sail!
